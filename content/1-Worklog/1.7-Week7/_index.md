### Results achieved in Week 7

- The team **finalized the project topic**:
  - Build a **Clickstream Analytics system for a computer & electronics e-commerce website**.
- Compared and **dropped the “house price prediction” idea** because:
  - It doesn’t align with Track 4 as well as clickstream.
- Produced **Architecture v1**:
  - Web → SDK → API → S3 → ETL → PostgreSQL → BI dashboard.
- For myself:
  - Started to connect AWS knowledge from earlier weeks to a concrete project.
  - Got a clearer view of the team’s scope of work in the coming weeks.
