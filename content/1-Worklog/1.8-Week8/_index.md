### Goals for Week 8

- Write and complete the project **proposal**.
- Adjust the architecture to match the proposed design.
- Clearly assign each part of the proposal to team members.
- Identify early the difficulties around **realtime vs batch** processing.

### Tasks for this week

| No. | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Start Date        | End Date        | References           |

| 1   | Team meeting: edit the proposal, divide sections (Technical Implementation, Timeline & Milestones, Budget Estimation, Risk Assessment, Expected Outcomes), discuss the difficulty of implementing a realtime solution.     | 20/10/2025 22:00  | 21/10/2025 01:40|  |
| 2   | Follow-up meeting: refine the architecture according to feedback, update it to be consistent with the proposal, finalize the **completed proposal**.                                                                      | 21/10/2025 19:00  | 21/10/2025 23:30|  |
| 3   | Personal: draft the **Risk Assessment** section (technical risks, cost risks, schedule risks, data risks) and propose mitigation strategies.                                        | 22/10/2025        | 23/10/2025      | |
| 4   | Full review of the proposal: check spelling, formatting, references, and ensure logical flow before submission.                                                                     | 24/10/2025        | 25/10/2025      |   |

### Results achieved in Week 8

- The proposal was **finalized**.
- The architecture was updated to:
  - Reflect the AWS services actually used.
  - Focus on **batch-based clickstream processing**, avoiding over-complicated realtime implementation.
- Personally:
  - I wrote the **Risk Assessment** section and learned:
    - Where the project is likely to fail (tech, cost, schedule, data).
    - The importance of having backup plans, tests, and realistic scope.
- The team now has a shared **technical “contract”** to follow in the next phases.
