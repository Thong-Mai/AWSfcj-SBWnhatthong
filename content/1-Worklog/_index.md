In this Worklog, I record my entire journey in the program, divided into **two main phases**:

- **Week 1 to Week 6**: Learning AWS fundamentals (cloud, networking, EC2, S3, security, databases, preparing for the project).
- **Week 7 to Week 13**: Implementing the **Clickstream Analytics project for an e-commerce site selling computers and related devices**, including: choosing the topic, designing the architecture, writing the proposal, building the web app, deploying with AWS/LocalStack/Terraform, designing data tables, monitoring the system, and finishing the Workshop.
