### [Blog 1 - AWS services scale to new heights for Prime Day 2025: key metrics and milestones](3.1-Blog1/)

The blog shares how AWS scaled its core services to handle record-breaking traffic during Amazon Prime Day 2025. It highlights impressive metrics across services such as Amazon EC2 with AWS Graviton, Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and Amazon SQS. It also introduces AWS Countdown, a program that helps customers prepare their own large-scale events with proven playbooks for capacity planning, resilience testing, and generative AI workloads.  

### [Blog 2 - Introducing Local Device Emulator for Verbatim Circuits on Amazon Braket](3.2-Blog2/)

The blog introduces a new local device emulator in Amazon Braket that allows developers to emulate verbatim circuits using real device calibration data. This emulator validates whether circuits are compatible with a specific quantum processing unit (QPU), applies realistic noise models derived from calibration data, and simulates execution locally. Developers can instantiate emulators directly from an AWS device or from saved device properties, catch errors early (such as unsupported gates or invalid qubit connections), and compare results between noiseless simulation, local noisy emulation, and actual hardware to build more accurate, noise-aware quantum algorithms.  

### [Blog 3 - Secure SAP HANA Cloud connectivity using AWS PrivateLink](3.3-Blog3/)

The blog describes how to secure connectivity to SAP HANA Cloud on AWS by integrating it with AWS PrivateLink. Instead of exposing SAP HANA Cloud over public endpoints, customers can create private VPC interface endpoints and Route 53 private hosted zones so that all database traffic stays within the AWS network. The post covers common use cases such as secure administrative access and secure data platform integration with services like AWS Glue and Amazon Athena, then walks through configuration steps (enabling PrivateLink in SAP HANA Cloud, creating VPC endpoints, DNS setup, and testing). It also discusses high availability patterns and cost considerations for PrivateLink-based architectures.
