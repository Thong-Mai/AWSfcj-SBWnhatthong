During my internship at **AWS First Cloud Journey** from **09/09/2025** to **09/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I gained at university in a real working environment. I was directly involved in building a Batch Clickstream Analytics platform on AWS for an e-commerce system, covering the entire processing pipeline from data ingestion and batch ETL to data warehouse construction and analytics dashboards.

Throughout this process, I further developed my skills in AWS solution architecture (VPC, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, EC2), data engineering and batch ETL design, learned how to use new supporting tools such as Git and Hugo, and gained hands-on experience with various AWS services. I also strengthened my knowledge of cloud security and networking (private subnets, NAT strategy), troubleshooting and debugging, technical documentation, and team collaboration during the project.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Needs Improvement

- Develop stronger discipline and compliance with rules and processes by proactively creating detailed plans for each work phase (from architecture updates, deployment, and testing to documentation), setting clear milestones and strictly following the agreed timeline. At the same time, minimize last-minute scope or requirement changes, thereby building a habit of working with proper planning and respecting the team’s and organization’s workflows.

- Build a more structured problem-solving mindset by forming the habit of documenting the context of each issue, its root cause, and the corresponding fix after every incident. This includes paying special attention to recurring categories of problems such as AWS networking errors, EventBridge configuration/scheduling issues, and PostgreSQL connection/configuration problems. Doing so not only shortens troubleshooting time in future cases but also creates a “knowledge base” or playbook that can be shared with other team members.

- Enhance communication and collaboration skills within the team by actively clarifying scope, responsibilities, and specific deadlines for each task. In addition, develop the habit of summarizing and presenting technical decisions and trade-offs (for example: NAT vs private-only, service placement, schema constraints) in a concise, easy-to-understand, and easy-to-share format (via meeting notes, internal chat messages, or short documents), helping everyone in the team stay aligned and reducing misunderstandings during execution.
