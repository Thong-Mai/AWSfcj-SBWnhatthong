### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working environment**  
The working environment at AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ) is highly professional while still being friendly and open. Everyone in the team is always willing to support me whenever I run into issues, even outside of normal working hours, which made “onboarding into the AWS ecosystem” feel very natural. The workspace is clean, quiet, and well-equipped, helping me stay focused and work more efficiently.  
If possible, adding more internal activities such as networking sessions, experience-sharing workshops, or team bonding events with an “AWS builders community” spirit would make the experience even better.

**2. Support from mentor / team admin**  
My mentor provided extremely detailed guidance, always explaining AWS concepts and best practices (from overall architecture to specific services) clearly whenever I didn’t understand something. I was especially impressed by the way my mentor encouraged me to think for myself and experiment directly on AWS instead of just giving me the final answer – this helped me “learn by doing” very effectively.  
The team admin was also very supportive, taking care of procedures, documentation, and schedule-related issues, creating a very favorable environment for me to focus on learning and building solutions on AWS. Because of that, I felt that this was not just a normal internship, but a true “first cloud journey.”

**3. Alignment between work and field of study**  
The tasks I was assigned were highly aligned with my academic background and, at the same time, closely tied to the AWS ecosystem – something that’s hard to get if you only study at school. The Batch Clickstream Analytics Platform project allowed me to connect my foundational knowledge (computer networks, databases, programming) with real AWS services such as S3, Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, EC2, and PostgreSQL in a cloud environment.  
In addition, I got exposure to new areas like cloud-native architecture, cloud security, and distributed system design – topics that are often only briefly mentioned in school, but here I actually got to “get my hands dirty” with them.

**4. Learning opportunities & skill development**  
During the internship, I learned a lot – not only technically but also about how to work in a professional cloud environment following AWS standards:

- Getting familiar with project organization, task management, and source control (Git, team workflows).
- Gaining a clearer understanding of how to design, deploy, and monitor a system running on AWS from a real-world perspective.
- Improving teamwork, presentation, and communication skills in a technical environment.  

My mentor and other team members did not just guide me on specific tasks, but also shared a lot of career experience and insights into building a path with AWS. That helped me form a clearer picture of my future direction, for example towards becoming a cloud or solution architect.

**5. Company culture & team spirit**  
The culture at FCJ is very positive and modern, strongly reflecting the AWS “builders” mindset: people respect each other, are always willing to help, and frequently pair up to work, review code, or review architecture together. Even though the working pace is serious and focused, the team atmosphere remains friendly and easy to communicate in.  
During high-pressure periods, everyone pushes together to get things done, without any division between interns and full-time staff – this made me feel like a true member of the team, not just a “temporary trainee.”

**6. Policies / benefits for interns**  
The company provides an internship allowance and flexible working hours when I need to accommodate classes or exams at university. On top of that, being able to join internal training sessions on AWS, system architecture, security, and more is a huge plus – these are sessions that, if I tried to learn on my own outside, would be more time-consuming and lack the real-world perspective that comes from people who are actually running live projects.

### Some other questions

- **What are you most satisfied with during the internship?**  
  What I am most satisfied with is being able to truly “live in the AWS environment”: almost every task I worked on was connected to one or more AWS services, giving me a much more holistic view of how to build a cloud-native system. At the same time, the strong support from my mentor and the team allowed me to confidently try, make mistakes, and then fix them – learning very fast, but without negative pressure.

- **What do you think the company could improve for future interns?**  
  I think the experience is already very good, but it could be even better by:
  - Adding more internal knowledge-sharing sessions in the form of mini-workshops focused on specific AWS topics (e.g., monitoring, security, cost optimization).  
  - Organizing some team bonding activities or small internal hackathons so interns have more opportunities to connect and freely experiment with different AWS services.  
  These are just “nice-to-have” suggestions to make an already strong program even more outstanding.

- **If you were to recommend this place to friends, would you encourage them to intern here? Why?**  
  Definitely **yes**. If my friends are serious about pursuing cloud, especially AWS, this is an excellent internship environment because:
  - You get to work on real projects, not just “simulated assignments.”
  - You receive strong and structured mentoring.
  - You get exposed to the AWS ecosystem in a methodical way – which is extremely valuable for your future career.

### Suggestions & expectations

- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
  - Organize more deep-dive knowledge-sharing sessions by topic (e.g., “One hour with CloudWatch & observability on AWS,” “Security best practices on AWS for beginners”).  
  - Create a “playbook for interns” including checklists, reference materials, and links to recorded workshops so new interns can ramp up more quickly from the first week.

- **Would you like to continue with this program in the future?**  
  Yes. If there is an opportunity, I would love to continue with the program in a more advanced internship role or join other AWS-based projects to go deeper into areas I am still missing.

- **Other comments (free sharing):**  
  I really appreciate my time interning at AWS First Cloud Journey. This was not just a way to “get enough credits” for school, but truly an important starting point for my journey with AWS and cloud in general. I hope the program will keep growing and expanding so more students can experience such a high-quality learning and working environment.
